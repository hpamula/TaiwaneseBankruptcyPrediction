# Classification
### Genearl idea
The idea is to analyse [the dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/company-bankruptcy-prediction/data), train several 
classification models, and based on the best model prepare a concise 
presentation summarising findings in a way intended for half-technical audience (think manager or 
company higher stakeholders).
In general the intention is to realise a whole data science workflow and reach meaningful 
conclusions based on a creative and curious approach to the data and ML models.
In the teamâ€™s best interest is to try as many (intelligent) things as possible.
### Implementation
To be able to compare results all teams must report same metrics: on a randomised train, 
validation, test split with proportions 70%-15%-15%.
Exploratory Data Analysis. Removing outliers, showing correlation matrix, removing strongly 
correlated features and data leaks, data normalisation (also taking care of long tail/asymmetric 
feature distributions when necessary).
For the best model: hyperparameters tuning and features selection. Features importance.
Final model evaluation and sample predictions on the test set.
Presentation with data science team findings summary.
